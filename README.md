# Stonehenge/SubtractSquare Game
* Built using object-oriented programming techniques from the Python course
* Iterative/recursive AI strategies
* Got a final mark of 93% on completion

## Rules
SubstractSquare: start from a number you want to subtract from, player 1 and player 2 (can be another person or the computer) take turns to play, who subtracts the number to 0 first win.

## How to start?
* Run the game_interface.py
* Choose the game you want to play (Stonehenge or SubstractSquare)
* Choose a strategy for player 1 and player 2 (Interactive, rough outcome(AI), recursive/iterative minimax(AI))
* Choose a number to subtract from (SubstractSquare)/ length of the board (Stonehenge)
* Have fun!
